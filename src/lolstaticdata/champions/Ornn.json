Returning to base still brings health and mana items back to full.\nOrnn's basic attacks against  Brittle enemies will end the duration of the debuff on-hit prematurely even if the  knock back is not applied.\nHis basic attacks against  Brittle epic  monsters will still cause the debuff to be consumed and the bonus damage to be dealt, despite the  knock back not being applied against them.\nThe reduction in  Tenacity will benefit all applicable types of  crowd control, not just  immobilizes. The following do not consume Brittle but benefit from the reduction:  blinds,  cripples,  disarms,  grounding,  silences, and  slows.\nCrowd control effects that are unaffected by Tenacity do not benefit from the reduction at all, which are  airborne,  drowsy,  nearsight,  stasis, and  suppression.\nAlthough  airborne effects won't last 30% longer, if the spell simultaneously  stuns the target, this stun will be extended and persist past the airborne duration, for an overall increased crowd control duration.\n Ornn's  Searing Charge and  Call of the Forge God each apply both airborne and stun simultaneously for the same duration for this reason.\nLiving Forge's increase in bonus health  stacks multiplicatively with  Vigilant Wardstone's Blessing of Ixtal.\nIt is not required to rank  Bellows Breath in order to apply Brittle.\nThe bonus magic damage inflicted by Brittle is credited to Ornn.\nThe magic damage benefits from Ornn's  magic penetration.\nMastercraft items and their components are not the same item and so in theory any unnamed passives would stack and any unnamed actives would only put themselves on cooldown upon activated.
