        "notes": "The target will not take Impale's secondary damage if the  suppression is removed before the duration ends.\nIf the target becomes  untargetable,  dies, or is too far away or no longer in  sight during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on  cooldown nor pay its cost (if applicable).\nThe range cancel distance is 800 units.\n Spell shield will not block the  root.\nImpale is special cased to end prematurely if the target is affected by  Devour, both for an ally and enemy  Tahm Kench or if Skarner is teleported by  Realm Warp.\nImpale will not end prematurely if Skarner enters  resurrection.\nSkarner cannot use  hex-gates during Impale.\nWhile Impale is active, and for the purposes of direction-conditioned abilities, (e.g.  Petrifying Gaze,  Mocking Shout) Skarner is considered to be facing in the direction he is moving and not the one his model is facing.\nImpale applies a small displacement to the target every 0.25 seconds whenever they are not close to Skarner. These displacements do not apply  airborne and are not flagged as displacements, meaning that targets who are not  immune to the  suppression are also never immune to the displacement either. As a consequence,  displacement immunity fails to ignore this movement. See the table below.\n\n\nSpecial interactions\n\n\n\nThe following  dashes are interrupted and do not apply their 'on dash completion' effects (if they have one) when successfully impaled:\n\n Corki's  The Package\n Nocturne's  Paranoia's recast\n Sett's  The Show Stopper\nThis ability  attaches its target to Sett. Dragging him out will detach that unit from him.\n Shyvana's  Dragon's Descent\n Vex's  Shadow Surge (recast)\n Yone's  Soul Unbound (recast)\nYone's very high dash speed makes it almost impossible to catch him during the dash. Skarner is required to be close enough to Yone and needs to have near-perfect timing with Impale's cast in order to successfully cancel the dash. If cast too early, the recast will be deferred to the end of Impale's duration, or if cast too late, Impale will be canceled as Yone is already too far away.\n\n\n\nThe following  dashes are stopped likewise with the ones mentioned above, however, they do apply 'on dash completion' effects and when their dash is interrupted, the ability's effects are centered around their initial stopping point from Impale.\n\n Hecarim's  Onslaught of Shadows\n Jarvan IV's  Cataclysm\nThe terrain that would usually be formed on impact is instead delayed until the forced movement of Impale ends. The displacement immunity is not removed.\n Malphite's  Unstoppable Force\n\n\n\nThe following abilities do not have any special interactions with Impale other than being displaced during their cast.\n\n Illaoi's  Leap of Faith\n Ornn's  Bellows Breath\nThe cast direction for this ability cannot be changed.\n Viego's  Heartbreaker\n\n\n\n Rek'Sai's  Void Rush has two different outcomes:\n\nImpale is cast before the burrow into the ground:\nRek'Sai will not  vanish while she's being dragged and her ultimate goes on a 10-second  cooldown after a brief delay. The displacement immunity is not removed in this case however, which ends when the ability cancels.\nImpale is cast after the emergence:\nRek'Sai's dash is interrupted.\n\n\n\n Vi's  Cease and Desist behaves differently in contrast to the previously noted examples due to its uniqueness.\n\nThe dash is not interrupted and the displacement immunity is not removed. Vi will continue to march towards the target while simultaneously being displaced by Impale and dragged to Skarner. Once Impale ends, she is free of the displacement and will perform the ability as normal.\nEnemies that come into range of her are still affected by entering her path.\nThe primary target is dealt the ability's final effects if they move into the respective range of Vi, thus performing the ability successfully in spite of Impale.\n\n\n\n Camille's  The Hextech Ultimatum is impractical to test, as it renders her  untargetable instantly the moment it's activated, which will always cancel Impale's cast, regardless of the timing.\n\n\n\n\n Kalista's  Fate's Call and  Tahm Kench's  Devour are not possible to test due to the target being  vanished, rendering them unable to be selected for unit-targeted abilities like Impale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\nCast time\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\n Shurelya's Battlesong  Turbo Chemtank  Youmuu's Ghostblade  Gargoyle Stoneplate  Randuin's Omen\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll the other item-actives are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nUsable\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath, unless protected by  Resurrection",
