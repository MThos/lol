This does include jungle plants, structures, and wards.\nWards will only be hit once by Burst Fire. Stealthed wards and traps will not be hit.\nChampion-summoned units behave differently depending on the unit.\nGangplank's  Powder Keg and Yorick’s  Dark Procession are hit only once by Burst Fire, and any subsequent rounds not empowered by  Spark Surge will stop upon reaching the same object.\nKalista’s  Sentinel is hit only once by Burst Fire, but any subsequent rounds will continue to travel through the Sentinel.\nIf Burst Fire hits an enemy while Zeri is not visible to enemies, the area around her (400 units) will be revealed for 4.5 seconds.\nBurst Fire rolls  critical strike for all rounds as well as the additional physical damage dealt when Zeri is  Overcharged.\nBurst Fire is parried by  dodge and  block.\n Blind causes Burst Fire to cast in a random direction. The rounds will still deal damage to enemies hit.\nBurst Fire's rounds are fired each in the target direction from where Zeri is at the time.\nOnly attack speed granted by being  Overcharged can exceed the cap of 1.5.\n Hail of Blades and  Lethal Tempo do not allow Zeri to exceed her attack speed cap.\nItems and runes that trigger off of attacking [eg  Fleet Footwork,  Phantom Dancer] will only trigger if Burst Fire hits a unit.\nIf Zeri would get enough stacks from a Burst Fire to be Energized, that Burst Fire will also become an Energized attack.\nBurst Fire's cast-indicator does not show the increased range when  Rapid Firecannon is ready.\nBurst Fire uses a modified icon when empowered by  Spark Surge () and  Lightning Crash () as well as both ().",
